## Abstract

### How It Works

### Technologies Used

Diamond was developed using a powerful combination of technologies, including:
- **REACT/JavaScript (JS)**: REACT/JS were crucial tools for creating the front-end, user-facing component of our application.
- **HTML & CSS**: HTML & CSS were used to create the user interface, providing an intuitive / visually appealing experience.
- **Python**: Python was used for all backend components, including (a) building the model, (b) creating all the visuals.
- **MATLAB**: Matplotlib (integrated Python module) was our go-to for data visualization.
- **GUROBI**: GUROBI was our optimization engine. We built our model and used our free student license to implement the Simplex solver.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook was the perfect choice for our final demo, as it provided interactive widgets.
